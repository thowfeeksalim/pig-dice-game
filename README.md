This project is a practice of creating a simple roll-dice game. You can interact with the app in the browser of your local machine and play with two players.
Built with JavaScript.

## GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. 
Each result get added to his ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. 
After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score 
gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
